# Hi!👋🏽 My name is Pujitha and I'm studying Data Science and Sociology at UC Berkeley.

Why this combo? Stemmed from my own experiences with sexism, I'm passionate about social change. I believe data science is a powerful tool to investigate social problems. Thus, I am on the lookout for cool projects particularly at the intersection of Data Science and social good!

Outside of my studies, my interests are photography, film, fashion, hiking, and meeting new people.

Feel free to reach me at pujithanachuri@berkeley.edu if you have any questions. I'd love to chat :)
